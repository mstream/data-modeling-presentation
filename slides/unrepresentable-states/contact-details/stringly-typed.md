# <mdi-book-alphabet class="text-blue-500" /> stringly typed

“Stringly typed” is a slang IT term related to coding strategies 
that describes the process where a developer 
uses string values excessively for variables. 
Stringly typed code is code in which variables are often typed as strings, 
and handled as strings, 
when there are better alternatives available to programmers.[^1]
